				Cleaning is not a necessity but a luxury, so the price is not negotiable. 
				We are available any day except for Saturday. We do move outs, move ins, one time, twice a month or every week cleanings. We try to use natural products as much as we can.
			</p>
			<p>We provide all the cloths and chemicals and paper towels, you provide vacuum cleaner.
			 All toilet work is done with paper towels,( for hygiene purposes). Everything else with designated microfiber cloths. We use Lysol for toilets and degreaser for the kitchen. Everything else is damp cloths or special furniture polish.</p>
